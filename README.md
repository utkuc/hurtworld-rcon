# Hurtworld Rcon Tool
Hurtworld Rcon Tool for executing commands without joining game.
This tool must be runned from server's machine(at least until devs implement some sort of real rcon thing)

If you are using Linux Server you need to connect your server with SSH and run RconTool from there.

If you are using hosting service probably you can't install-use this tool.
